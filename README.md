<br/>

### <a href="https://rosliy.github.io/infotecs/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>

### Task:
At the input we have an array of objects. It is necessary to display them in the form of a list (an example view of the application is below). When you hover over the name of an element from the list, a panel should appear in which the description and characteristics of the selected element will be displayed. If none of the items is selected, the popup panel is not displayed.

- data for the list is taken from https://dummyjson.com/products
- implemented function: 
    - Drag and Drop;
    - Sort by price, sort by title;
